# Key Features
    Data Exploration: We dive into the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and explore patterns within the data.
    Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the dataset for model training.
    Model Selection: Linear Regression was considered for the machine learning process.
    Model Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to gauge the model's predictive power.
    Predictive Insights: We provide insights into the most influential features contributing to heart disease risk.

Usage
