# Key Features

# Data Exploration
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Visualized feature distributions and correlations (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
Identified key risk factors influencing heart disease.

# Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
Normalized/standardized numerical variables for consistent scaling.
Performed feature engineering to improve model performance.

# Model Selection

Linear Regression was chosen as the baseline model for predicting risk probability.
Considered other models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) for comparison.

# Model Evaluation
Assessed model performance using:
Accuracy – overall correctness.
Precision – ability to correctly identify positive cases.
Recall (Sensitivity) – ability to capture true heart disease cases.
F1-Score – balance between precision and recall.
ROC-AUC – model’s ability to discriminate between classes.

# Predictive Insights
Identified the most influential features (e.g., cholesterol level, age, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate).
Generated insights into patient risk factors to support decision-making

# Results
The trained model achieved promising performance, demonstrating the feasibility of using machine learning for medical predictions.
Visualization of feature importance highlighted cholesterol, age, and maximum heart rate as strong predictors.
